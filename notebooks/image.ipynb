      "Epithelial tissues are sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body, lines internal cavities and passageways, and forms certain glands. It has a few distinct features. First, epithelial tissues are highly cellular, with little or no extracellular space in between cells. Second, the cells exhibit polarity with differences in structure and function between the exposed or apical facing surface of the cell and the basal surface close to the underlying body structures. Finally, epithelial tissues are nearly completely avascular; this means that no blood vessels cross the basement membrane to enter the tissue, and nutrients must come by diffusion or absorption from underlying tissues or the surface.  \n",

      "Epithelial tissues are classified according to the shape of the cells and number of the cell layers formed. Cell shapes can be squamous (flattened and thin), cuboidal (boxy, as wide as it is tall), or columnar (rectangular, taller than it is wide). The number of cell layers in the tissue can be one—where every cell rests on the basal lamina—which is a simple epithelium, or more than one, which is a stratified epithelium and only the basal layer of cells rests on the basal lamina. Pseudostratified (pseudo- = “false”) describes tissue with a single layer of irregularly shaped cells that give the appearance of more than one layer. Transitional describes a form of specialized stratified epithelium in which the shape of the cells can vary. (Figure 4.6 on page 138). \n",
